# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @Vogon-P0et

Hailed as the 3rd most terrible coder in the Galaxy, superior only to my two young children

## Location
USA, Floridaü¶©

## Why I'm here
I'm a 40- something career changer and business owner. My wife and I own a single location dental practice in North Florida and I own and operate a small digital marketing agency that has a handful of clients. One of those clients is my dental practice, so definitely not Fortune 500 status yet üìâ.

I hope to add the skills I'm learning to my resume- to make myself more capable and knowlegeable in order to maximize the marketing efforts for my wife's business and for my clients. I just started my coding journey with Coding Temple and I'll soon be enabled with the skills of a full-stack developer. As I plan to keep my marketing company small, I'll be looking to secure a job, hopefully, to utlize the knowledge gained in my journeys through science, education, healthcare, marketing, and business ownership, but I would honestly be grateful for just about any opportunity to get started on a shared project. I constantly seek improvement and love educating myself.  

## Currently working on
I have just started my coding journey, but I'll start a list here:
- computer science basics
- command line interfaces(shells)
- basic github terminal commands

## Resume
‚è≥ My resume will soon be available here:

## About me
‚ö† Read on if you dare...I'm still honing my Vogon poetry, but I'm certain this will at least bore you to death... ‚ö†

As a husband, father of two boys, and a business owner, I'm a pretty busy guy. After dropping out of high school back in 1999, I struggled to find my place. I got my GED and started college part-time in 2004. It took the long road, but I graduated as a biology major, went on to get some post bac training in medical health sciences at the Mayo Clinic, and then spent nearly a decade working in medical laboratories, as a Clinical Lab Scientist and supervisor. After moving on from hospitals and shift work, I decided to start teaching high school, which happened in 2020 as COVID-19 was hitting the scene. I spent three years teaching Chemistry, Biology and Environmental Science- all through the pandemic. Over those three long years, I put up with some crazy stuff from students, fellow teachers, administrators, hybrid and remote instruction, social distancing in tiny classes, the weird and corrupt educational system and it's agendas, etc. I had enough of that and left to help my wife establish her first office. My wife is a dentist, so I help wherever I can be of value, but that's her thing. 

I'm a father to two amazing boys, ages 6 and 10, and married to my beautiful wife of 13 and a half years. I'm an extremely fortunate guy that has been through some personal struggles, and has come out on the other end a better and stronger man. I struggle with ADHD and mental health issue, mostly anxiety and depression stemming from ADHD. I try to be an extremely compassionate and loving person. I don't dislike anyone from the start. You don't have to earn my trust...I offer it freely. I'm often taken advantage of for my kindness but I'll continue to offer it. I'm a strong believer that our actions ripple through the world and I strive everyday to elevate our conciousness rather than contribute to the ignorance and hate that poisons our society. 

üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I love to listen to Ram Dass, Eckhart Tolle, as well as other great thinkers, spiritual leaders, and prominent business minds. Mostly audiobooks and lectures. Turn on, Tune in, Drop out - Timothy Leary

I love movies from my childhood but, honestly, I don't watch too many movies anymore. I'm a fan of reading, and read daily, although rarely for leisure anymore. I love the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Movie, TV series, and book), Monty Python everything, John Cleese everything. My favorite movie list would be too long to even start. 

Let me know if there's more you'd like to know about me.

My marketing company is extremely new, so I don't have my site up yet, but it will soon be at innvisia.com. As my skills grow, I'll write the site myself, so please excuse as it's under construction.
